# Balance Map Analysis
## Overview
Matlab code for balance map analysis which evaluate walking balance.
Simulation results presented at ICRA2019 were produced by the matlab functions. The conference paper can be uploaded soon.

## Dependency
The simulations were built in matlab 2014b.

## Setup
Please download and extract zip file. The following matlab functions generate figures of the simulation results.

*BalanceMap.m* plots boundary lines of fall regions. 

*TwoLinkModel_sim.m* performs computer simulations of a swing movement with and without disturbance.

*TwoLinkModel_comp.m* performs computer simulations of a linear and a nonlinear compass gait model.
