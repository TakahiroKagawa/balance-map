# Balance Map Analysis
## Overview
Matlab code for balance map analysis which evaluate walking balance.
Simulation results presented at ICRA2019 were produced by the matlab functions. 
The conference paper can be find at the following link

## Dependency
The simulations were built in matlab 2014b.

## Setup
Please download and extract zip file. The following matlab functions generate figures of the simulation results.

*BalanceMap.m* plots boundary lines of fall regions. 

*TwoLinkModel_sim.m* performs computer simulations of a swing movement with and without disturbance.

*TwoLinkModel_comp.m* performs computer simulations of a linear and a nonlinear compass gait model.
